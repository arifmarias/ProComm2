##A Pronunciation Learning Tool##

ProComm2 is a complete redesign of an existing Pronunciation Learning Tool (named ProComm as one might guess!) originally developed using Adobe Flash.

The goal of this project was to redesign and implement this tool using modern web standards.
This tool was developed for UBC Faculty of Arts Instructional Support and Information Technology (Arts ISIT) and is currently in use by many students in language courses at the University of British Columbia.
